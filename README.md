# ATS_FER2024
Facial Emotion Recognition Turkish Celebrities Dataset

The introduction of a novel facial expression dataset, ATS_FER_DB_2024, emerges as a crucial milestone in the landscape of Facial Expression Recognition (FER) research. 
This dataset, consisting of 183 images of Turkish celebrities, has been meticulously curated from diverse sources, including the Internet and television series. 
The merger of these sources not only enriches the dataset with a broad spectrum of facial expressions but also infuses cultural diversity into the realm of FER.

During the dataset labeling process, three experts independently classified the data. The labeling process was then completed using the majority method for each image. 
In cases where each expert labeled an image differently, the researchers assigned the most appropriate label to the data. The statistics of the ATS_FER2024 dataset are presented below.
